<p>
Start by disabling "send immediately"
</p>
<p>
Just hit send, and store your e-mail in your Outbox.
<br>
Before you close your mailclient or at the end of the day, review your e-mails and hit F9 to send them. 
It's a kind of respect for your readers. Any e-mail sent is handled with care.
</p>
<p>
You are in control of the sending time. 
<br>
You bulk send them at specific times, so you won't receive chat-like short answers, you won't start a conversation over
e-mail anymore. It doesn't work. Use a chat application or get a room.
