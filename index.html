<p>
Start by disabling "send immediately"
</p>
<p>
Just hit send, and store them in your Outbox.
Before you close the application, hit F9, and send them. You still have the
chance to review them before sending.
It's a kind of respect for your readers. Any mail sent is handled with care.
</p>
<p>
You are in control of the sending time. 
You bulk send them at specific times.
You don't receive random short answers, you don't start a conversation over
e-mail anymore. It doesn't work. Use a chat application or get a room.
</p>
<p>
Plus you GTD.
